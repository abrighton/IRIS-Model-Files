This command will perform the following actions depending on the selected mode for each of the three OIWFS detectors: SINGLE (initiate a single exposure), CONTINUOUS (continuously take exposures as triggered by NFIRAOS trigger signal and simultaneously step through the guide and acquisition table), STOP (stop exposure), or NOOP (leave exposure mode unchanged). SINGLE exposures are intended to generate test and calibration data. When SINGLE is specified, the other arguments must also be provided: filenames for each detector exposure (including either a '_flat' or '_dark' suffix if being used to generate calibration data), as well as the number of coadds and total integration time for the exposure.
