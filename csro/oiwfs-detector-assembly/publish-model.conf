      <em>
      Discussion: These scale factors will be beneficial to reduce data size when reading out a large region of interest window quickly, especially with an OIWFS detector employing e.g. a Leonardo APD array.

      Discussion: This telemetry it is not needed if IRIS transmits floating point pixel values to the NRTC.
