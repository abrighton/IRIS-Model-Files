The current state of the OIWFS enclosure environment.

The environmental sensor values published with this event are derived from values published by the PLC and are suitable for making control decisions.

<em>
Discussion: The OIWFS Enclosure environment is controlled by a PLC and when commanded will follow the NFIRAOS optical enclosure states.  Frost point is germane below 0<sup>&deg;</sup>C and dewpoint applies above freezing.  Condensation temperature (Frost and dew point ) is a  more directly useful measurement of water vapour than relative humidity --  if the air temperature is below the condensation point, then water will precipitate.

Discussion: Whether IRIS is Mechanically attached to NFIRAOS is reflected in the software 'configuration' of IRIS, so that NFIRAOS NCC knows whether the published values in this table are relevant.
