The OIWFS Probe Arm Assembly (POA) consists of three functional groups:

  * **pos**: Controls the positions of the probes, as well as passively setting their fold mirrors and collimators based on those positions.
  * **mode**: Switches between TT and TTF optics for each OIWFS.
  * **cal**: Used to activate calibration light sources on each probe.
