          <em>
          Discussion: NFIRAOS delivers a curved focal surface to IRIS, while the OIWFS probes and imager lie in approximately flat planes that are only tangent to the focal surface at some arbitrary points. Therefore, measurements by an OIWFS used by NFIRAOS to correct the image at a different, arbitrary location on the imager will require offsets via these reference vectors. Two examples of errors that can be handled with this mechanism are:
          <ul>
          <li> Focus: The best focus obtained from a TTF sensor will differ from that for an arbitrary location on the imager, depending on their relative distances from the focal surface. By reporting the expected (X,Y) shifts of all 4 centroids obtained from the lenslet array, the amount they collectively move in or out is proportional to this defocus.
          <li> Translational errors: Translational errors in OIWFS spot locations may also occur in a way that is not easy to calibrate as part of the instrument pointing model. For example, rotator bearing deformities (causing, e.g., nutation of the rotation axis) may cause differential motion of the probe arm locations and imager towards and away from the optical axis. Such errors would affect both TT and TTF sensors.
          </ul>

          Discussion: A new event will be published during initialization for each observation (TBD what the rate will be during an observation).
