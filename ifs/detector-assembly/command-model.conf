IFS Detector Assembly Commands.

This command model is designed based on [Software Design Patterns for Device and Component Controllers (TMT.INS.TEC.16.079.DRF01)](https://docushare.tmt.org/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-57492/cc_design_patterns_DRF01_b.docx). As proposed by the design pattern, standard assembly commands and assembly-specific commands are provided for each functional group. All commands are classified into either 'request' or 'submit' based on the command type defintion described in the design pattern document.

This command causes the assembly to initialize its variables, read configuration , and verify dependencies.
