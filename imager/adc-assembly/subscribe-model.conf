IRIS Science Path ADC Assembly subscribes to some events from TCS to calculate the angle of two prisms. Orientation of the elevation axis (target orientation of ADC) is given in FCRS<sub>IRIS-ROT</sub> which rotates with respect to NFIRAOS. Thus, this assembly does not have to monitor instrument rotator angle.
