description = """
The Imager Detector Assembly is responsible for configuring and executing individual exposures via the Sidecar or ARC HCD. It will also track status of exposures and report, and provide for aborting exposures.

This assembly is very similar to the IFS Detector Assembly, and may in fact use identical code, if the same HCD is used. It is likely that the Imager will use
four detectors, in which case this assembly will additionally be responsible for coordination.

On-chip guiding is coordinated by odgw-assembly separately.

The list below is the definition of terms related to sampling method.

* pixel readtime       : Time to select and read one pixel
* number of channels   : Number of channels. Each channel can read one pixel at a time.  In case of HAWAII-4RG, this can be 1, 4, 16, 32, 64 (TBC).
* reset                : Action to reset all pixels to reset level in a given sub-region
* read                 : One read samples all pixels in a given sub-region.
* frame time           : Time to read or reset all pixels in a given sub-region (assuming the time to reset and read is the same). <frame time> = <number of pixels in a given sub-region> x <pixel readtime> / <number of channels>
* readout              : An 2D array image generated by each read. All readouts will be saved to a local data store provided by the instrument.
* immediate reduction  : Image processing made for each readout.
* group                : A sequence of one or more reads. In case of CDS and Fowler Sampling, the number of group in one ramp is 2.
* integration time     : Time between two adjacent groups in one ramp.  (This configuration cannot be specified in case of UTR.)
* ramp                 : A sequence of one or more resets followed by one or more reads.
* sampling arithmetic  : Process to combine multiple readouts into one frame when a ramp is completed.
* ramp raw frame       : An 2D array image produced by sampling arithmetic. (__TBC__)
* exposure             : A sequence of one or more ramps. (__TBC__)
* coaddition           : A process to add or average multiple ramp raw frames.
* science raw frame    : An 2D array image generated by each exposure as a result of combining all readouts in the exposure.
