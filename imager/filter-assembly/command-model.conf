Commands which can be accepted by IRIS Filter Assembly.

Commands will be rejected immediately when the assembly is not in an appropriate state.

This command model is intended to list up possible commands reuqired to perform testing, engineering, observation configuration and observation. Main purpose of this command model is to smoke out information about what kind of instructions would be made by a person (it may be an engineer, an instrument specialist or an observer) for all use cases, not just for observation. Thus, most of the commands are very low level. In the future, a high level set-up command for observation would be defined to more or less autonomously perform observation instead of issuing low level commands one by one.

All the commands do NOT block the caller, but they are executed asynchronously. The response to each command will be sent back to the caller after some time. This time would be ranging from very short time (millisecond order or even less) to very long time (several seconds or a bit more). In principle, the response will be sent back when the specified action is completed, but the response may be sent back immediately if the command is invalid (e.g. sending SELECT command before datuming is completed) or invalid argument is given.

There is no command queues in an Assembly component as described in [TMT Software Detailed Design (CSW) (TMT.SFT.TEC.15.002.REL01)](https://docushare.tmt.org/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-49912/TMTSoftwareDesign-CSWPD_REL01.pdf). Only one command can be processed at a time, and commands will not be pooled in a queue for later processing. If a command (except 'stop' command) is sent to this assembly while it is processing a previous command, this assembly will immediately return an error response which indicates another action is on-going. Note that this command queue issue depens on future CSW implementation.

__TBD__: If no blank filter is inserted, this assembly first rotates one filter wheel to insert a blank filter so that excessive light will not enter the detectors unexpectedly. After the blank filter is inserted, it starts homing of all other 4 axes in parallel. After the homing is completed, this assembly inserts a blank filter in one of the 4 wheels to make sure that no excessive light will enter while homing the remaining wheel, and triggers homing of the reamining wheel.

Successful execution will result in Normal:Ready.

__TBD__: This command is also used to unlock and index the machanisms after cooling or pressurizing is completed. Unlock and index mechanisms should be done in 'Activate' and 'Warm Active' use cases as defined in [IRIS - Software Design Document (TMT.INS.PDD.14.024.DRF07)](https://docushare.tmt.org/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-32613/160210_IRIS_SDD_DRF07.docx). This command does unlock and index actions at once. To prevent from moving the axes from moving by mistake, this command will not be accepted if the dewer is not in either Activate or Warm Activate stage.
