description = """
This assembly is responsible for putting the selected filter into the science beam for both Imager and IFS. This involves coordinating the motion of multiple filter wheels or mechanisms.

Power control of the motion controller will be done at sequencer level through power-assembly.

For normal motion, point-to-point motion in trapezoidal profile will be used.

__TBD__: 'float' is used for all floating points values if not specified. For the values which require more precision, it can be replaced by 'double'.

__TBD__: Find Edge routine is used for finding home position for all five axes.

__TBD__: There will be one dedicated motion controller (DMG-4050) for this assembly, but it is also possible share one motion controller with other assemblies. galil-hcd is considered to control the motion controller. The motion controller may be changed to something else to pursue better positioning accuracy. Motors are likely to be Phytron VSS series.

__TBD__: Need to perform backlash compensation? (e.g. move wheels in only one direction)

__TODO__: Define alarms.

__TODO__: Need to fill out a requirement 'All IRIS software components shall have a simulation mode' (REQ-3-IRIW-SW-0130).

__TODO__: Draw transition diagram.

__TODO__: Check the number of filters per one filter wheel.
