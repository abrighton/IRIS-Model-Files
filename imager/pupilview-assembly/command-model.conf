Commands which can be accepted by IRIS Pupil Viewing Mode Assembly.

This command model is designed based on [Software Design Patterns for Device and Component Controllers (TMT.INS.TEC.16.079.DRF01)](https://docushare.tmt.org/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-57492/cc_design_patterns_DRF01_b.docx). As proposed by the design pattern, standard assembly commands and assembly-specific commands are provided for each functional group. All commands are classified into either 'request' or 'submit' based on the command type defintion described in the design pattern document.

This command causes the assembly to initialize its variables, read configuration, and verify dependencies.  It prepares the assembly internally such that it is available to communicate with outside processes and begin managing the detectors.  It does not cause any readout or reset on the detector, but it validates the connections and hardware presence before completing. It also applies the detector configurations DETECTOR-CONF( (e.g. gain, number of channels) to each detector. Programs and configurations (e.g. this could be DSP code in the case of ARC controller) may be downloaded to the detector controllers if necessary.

This command can be invoked only when there is no exposure in progress. All commands will be rejected during the initialization.

Initialization can fail for various reasons including HCD communication failure, hardware failure, or invalid configuration. In this case, the command state will report an error.
